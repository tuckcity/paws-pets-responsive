`You're taking your freelancing skills to the streets and noticed a pet adoption agency doesn't have a website. You offer to create one for them and sell it. They happily agree and tell you what they would like. Your job is to review the mockup and all images that the owner has provided for you. Try your best to recreate what they're asking for!`
